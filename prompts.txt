make an android mobile app that able to record all of my online-shop orders from customers (like a database). I want the app able to retreive data, input a date of the orders, then can display all of the upcoming orders. The orders that got recorded already will still be edited as well. The home section will include: Input, Retrieve, display all of the upcoming orders, and edit. The format of the upcoming orders should include: Day&date&time the order have been placed, what kind of products needs to be sent, and the name of the buyers. It will also be able to record which platform is it from (for example: Tokopedia/Shopee), and which courier that'll, send the package (for example: JNE, SPX, SiCepat, Wahana, J&T, Lion Parcel, J&tCargo). Make the UI as seamless as possible.
make the products section to be in list format
